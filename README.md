# Monocopy-Goto
I am documenting my search for, and preservation of, Eiichi Goto's 1974 work "Monocopy and Associative Algorithms in an Extended Lisp"

After searching the normal channels for years, I was told the official archive of Eiichi Goto's work does not contain this paper. As it has been cited hundreds of times, I feel that it is of paramount importance to preserve this document as an important part of computing history.
In my opinion, it is the first real description of hash consing as a general purpose programming pattern, put into practice.

The provenance of my copy is that it was obtained from an archive with other related papers belonging to Warren Hunt at the University of Texas.
Dr. Hunt believes that this copy was likely sourced from the UT library. The metadata suggests that it was scanned in 2006, and the semi-transparency shows that it was a paper copy.
I am providing this pdf solely to preserve this chain of custody, and the underlining etc. are not my own, nor Dr. Goto's.

I will be producing a new version of this paper in this repository, both in plain text and with modern typesetting and updated diagrams.
